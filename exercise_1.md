**Objective: Write your first prompts and observe outputs.**

Write a direct instruction prompt (e.g., “List three programming languages”).

Compare how the model answers each type.
    From my observation, there is a difference in how ChatGPT answers those two prompts. In the first one. There is difference in depth, scope, and structure.
    
    In the first answer, the response is short and direct while that of jornaling is slightly deeper and more analytical.
