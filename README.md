# prompt-basic

## Overview

What is a prompt?

* Anatomy of a prompt (system, user, assistant messages)

* Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting

* Introduction to completions in ChatGPT / Playground

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the structure and components of a prompt

* Distinguish between zero-shot and few-shot prompting

* Practice generating consistent outputs with simple prompts

* Explore how parameters like temperature and top-p affect model behavior

## Exercises of the day
**Exercise 0**: Environment and Libraries

**Exercise 1:** Simple prompt writing

**Exercise 2**: Instruction refinement

**Exercise 3:** Parameter experimentation

## Virtual Environment
OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface

Python 3.9+ installed locally (optional, for simulating API workflows)

## Exercise 0: Environment and libraries
**Objective:** Set up the environment for Python development.

Install Python (latest stable version, preferably 3.9+).

Verify installation by running:

`python --version`

Write and execute a Hello, World! program.

## Exercise 1: Simple Prompt Writing
**Objective**: Write your first prompts and observe outputs.

Write a direct instruction prompt (e.g., “List three programming languages”).

Write a question style prompt (e.g., “What are the benefits of Python for AI?”).

Compare how the model answers each type.

## Exercise 2: Instruction Refinement
**Objective:** Convert vague requests into precise prompts.

Start with a vague request like: “Tell me about AI.”

Refine it step by step into a clear instruction, e.g.,

“Explain AI in simple terms for beginners.”

“Summarize the main AI techniques in 5 bullet points.”

Compare outputs and note differences.

## Exercise 3: Parameter Experimentation
**Objective:** Understand how parameters  affect output diversity.

Use the same prompt with temperature = 0.2 and then with temperature = 0.9.

Repeat with different top-p values (e.g., 0.5 vs 1).

Record how the style, randomness, and focus of responses change.

## Submission
Provide all exercises. For each exercise include the prompts, model outputs, and a brief sentence analysis highlighting differences in output, clarity, or behavior.
