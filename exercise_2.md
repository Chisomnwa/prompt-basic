# Exercise 2: Instruction Refinement
**Objective: Convert vague requests into precise prompts.**

Start with a vague request like: “Tell me about AI.”
    I asked AI "Tell me about cloud computing." and here is its response:

    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet instead of using a local computer or physical server.

    In simple terms:

    Instead of owning and managing hardware, you rent computing power, storage, and services from a provider.


    🔹 What It Provides
    Cloud computing typically offers:

    Storage
        - Save files and databases online
        - Access from anywhere

    Computing Power
        - Run applications
        - Process large amounts of data

    Networking
    - Connect systems and services
    - Manage traffic and security

    Software Services
    - Use applications via the browser
    - No local installation required

    🔹 Main Service Models
    1️⃣ IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
        - Virtual machines
        - Storage
        - Networks
        - Example: Renting a virtual server

    2️⃣ PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Environment to build and deploy applications
    - Handles infrastructure automatically
    - Example: Hosting your backend without managing servers

    3️⃣ SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Ready-to-use software
    - Accessed via browser
    - Example: Google Docs

    🔹 Key Benefits
        - Scalability → Increase or decrease resources instantly
        - Cost efficiency → Pay only for what you use
        - Reliability → High uptime and backups
        - Accessibility → Access from anywhere with internet

    🔹 Real-World Examples
        - AWS (Amazon Web Services)
        - Microsoft Azure
        - Google Cloud Platform


Refine it step by step into a clear instruction, e.g.,

“Explain AI in simple terms for beginners.”

“Summarize the main AI techniques in 5 bullet points.”

    I optimised the prompts into:

    1. If I were a beginner, explain cloud computing.

    Its response:
    
    Imagine you have a laptop.

    Normally, everything runs on your laptop:

    Your files are stored there

    Your apps run there

    Your games run there

    Now imagine your laptop is small and not very powerful.

    Instead of doing everything on it, you connect to very powerful computers somewhere else through the internet.

    That is cloud computing.

    ***Simple Definition***

    Cloud computing means using computers and storage over the internet instead of on your own device.

    ***Real-Life Example***

    When you use:

    Google Drive → your files are stored in the cloud

    Netflix → movies are streamed from cloud servers

    Gmail → emails are stored in the cloud

    Those companies have huge buildings called data centers filled with powerful computers.

    You connect to them through the internet.

    ***Why is it useful?***
    1️⃣ You don’t need expensive hardware

    You don’t have to buy big servers.

    2️⃣ You can access things anywhere

    Phone, laptop, cybercafé — as long as there’s internet.

    3️⃣ It can grow easily

    If your app gets more users, you can increase power quickly.

    ***Very Simple Analogy***

    Think of it like renting:

    Instead of buying a generator,

    You pay someone who already has electricity.

    Cloud = renting computing power.
    


    2. Summarize the main benefits of cloud computing in five bulet points.
    
    **Cost efficiency** — Pay only for the resources you use; no need to buy physical servers.

    **Scalability** — Easily increase or decrease computing power based on demand.

    **Accessibility** — Access applications and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

    **Reliability** — Built-in backups, redundancy, and high uptime.

    **Faster deployment** — Launch servers and applications quickly without complex hardware setup.

Compare outputs and note differences.
    The answers adapt to the topic complexity and your role as the audience. Simple physical concepts get short, clear bullets points. Mental or technical concepts get longer, layered explanations with examples and analogies. The structure and depth depend on how abstract the topic is and how beginner-friendly the explanation neds to be.
